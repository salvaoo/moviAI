This is a movie recommendation website created in [Next.js 13](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). This project is created with `create-t3-app` and I used the AMAZING [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components library.

## What it does?

I give to the user the ability to search by genres and get the best 15 movies recommendations based on these genres. The recommendation is get from the new **gpt-3.5-turbo** from **openAI**. The user can also see the movie details, the people votes, etc..
